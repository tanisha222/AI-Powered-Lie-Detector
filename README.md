## 🧠 Features

✔️ Real-time webcam capture
✔️ Facial expression analysis
✔️ AI-based classification for truth vs deception
✔️ Simple UI interface via `app.py`

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow the steps below to run the project on your local machine.

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tanisha222/AI-Powered-Lie-Detector.git
cd AI-Powered-Lie-Detector
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

Make sure Python 3.8 or above is installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

Once executed, the webcam will open and begin analyzing facial expressions in real time.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. The webcam captures live video frames using OpenCV
2. Faces are detected from each frame
3. Facial features and expressions are extracted
4. The machine learning model analyzes the data
5. The system predicts whether the expression indicates **Truth** or **Lie**

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* Python
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Machine Learning (Scikit-learn or similar)
* Computer Vision

---

## 📊 Output

* Live webcam video feed
* Face detection bounding box
* On-screen prediction showing **Truth** or **Lie**

---

## 🔬 Accuracy & Limitations

* Facial expressions alone cannot guarantee accurate lie detection
* Results depend on lighting, camera quality, and facial angles
* Human emotions vary between individuals

This project is best suited for educational, academic, and demonstration purposes.

---

## 🌟 Future Enhancements

* Add voice and speech analysis
* Use deep learning models (CNN / LSTM)
* Improve dataset and training accuracy
* Add a graphical user interface (GUI)
* Display confidence score with predictions
